# Audio Signal Synthesis and Music Generator

This project demonstrates the generation and visualization of various audio signal waveforms and the creation of a simple musical composition. The project was developed as part of a laboratory exercise at the Technical University.

## Features

### Audio Signal Synthesis
**Supported Signal Types**:
  - Sine wave
  - Rectangular wave
  - Asymmetric triangular wave
  - Symmetric triangular wave
**Visualizations**:
  - Time-domain signal plots
  - Frequency spectra
**Output**:
  - Signals are saved as `.wav` files.

### Music Generator
- Generate a sequence of notes using sine waves.
- Save the musical composition as a `.wav` file.
- Includes an example melody ("Für Elise" by Beethoven).

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omer-mestan/Audio_Signal.git
   cd Audio_Signal
      ```
### Set Up Python Environment
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
## Install Dependencies

### Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
### If requirements.txt is not available, install the libraries manually:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
### Run Audio Signal Synthesis Program
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the audio signal synthesis script:
 ```bash
python audio_signal_synthesis_template.py
   ```

### Outputs:
- .wav files for each waveform type (e.g., sine_wave.wav).
- Visualizations of the signals in both time and frequency domains.

### Run Music Generator Program
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the music generator script

 ```bash
 python music_generator.py
 ```

### Output:
- A .wav file named composed_music.wav containing the generated musical compositio

## Example Output Files
### The following files are generated by the program:
- sine_wave.wav
- rectangular_wave.wav
- asymmetric_triangle_wave.wav
- symmetric_triangle_wave.wav
- composed_music.wav

## Dependencies

## This project requires the following:
- Python: Version 3.8 or higher
- Libraries:
- numpy: For numerical computations
- scipy: For signal processing
- matplotlib: For visualizations

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for custom waveforms and user-defined signal parameters.
- Extend the music generator to include multiple instruments and wave types.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- Include real-time audio playback during signal generation.
