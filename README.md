# Audio Signal Synthesis and Music Generator

This project demonstrates the generation and visualization of various audio signal waveforms and the creation of a simple musical composition. The project was developed as part of a laboratory exercise at the Technical University.

## Features

### Audio Signal Synthesis
- **Supported Signal Types**:
  - Sine wave
  - Rectangular wave
  - Asymmetric triangular wave
  - Symmetric triangular wave
- **Visualizations**:
  - Time-domain signal plots
  - Frequency spectra
- **Output**:
  - Signals are saved as `.wav` files.

### Music Generator
- Generate a sequence of notes using sine waves.
- Save the musical composition as a `.wav` file.
- Includes an example melody ("FÃ¼r Elise" by Beethoven).

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
