# Audio Signal Synthesis and Music Generator

This project demonstrates the generation and visualization of different types of audio signals and the creation of simple musical compositions using Python. The project includes two main components: 

1. **Audio Signal Synthesis**: Generation and visualization of sine, rectangular, asymmetric triangular, and symmetric triangular waves.
2. **Music Generator**: A program to create musical compositions using sine wave signals for individual notes.

## Features

### Audio Signal Synthesis
- **Signal Types**:
  - Sine wave
  - Rectangular wave
  - Asymmetric triangular wave
  - Symmetric triangular wave
- **Visualizations**:
  - Time-domain signal plot
  - Frequency spectrum
- **Output**:
  - Save generated signals as `.wav` files.

### Music Generator
- Generate a sequence of notes using sine waves.
- Save the musical composition as a `.wav` file.
- Example notes from "FÃ¼r Elise" by Beethoven.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omer-mestan/Audio_Signal.git
   cd Audio_Signal
